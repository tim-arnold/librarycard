# API Reference

This document describes the LibraryCard API endpoints provided by the Cloudflare Worker.

## Base URL

```
https://your-worker-name.your-subdomain.workers.dev
```

## Authentication

The API uses Bearer token authentication with user email as the token for development. In production, this would be replaced with proper JWT tokens from NextAuth.

All endpoints (except public auth endpoints) require authentication:

```http
Authorization: Bearer user@example.com
```

## Authorization

LibraryCard implements role-based access control:

- **Admin Users**: Can create, update, and delete locations and shelves
- **Regular Users**: Can only add, update, and delete books
- All users can view locations and shelves they have access to

The UI automatically hides admin-only buttons for regular users.

## Examples

### Complete Workflow Example

```bash
# 1. Create a user (called automatically by OAuth)
curl -X POST https://your-worker-name.your-subdomain.workers.dev/api/users \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "id": "user@example.com",
    "email": "user@example.com", 
    "first_name": "John",
    "last_name": "Doe"
  }'

# 2. Create a location
curl -X POST https://your-worker-name.your-subdomain.workers.dev/api/locations \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer user@example.com" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "name": "Home Library",
    "description": "Main collection at home"
  }'

# 3. Add a shelf to the location
curl -X POST https://your-worker-name.your-subdomain.workers.dev/api/locations/1/shelves \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer user@example.com" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "name": "Science Fiction"
  }'

# 4. Add a book to the shelf
curl -X POST https://your-worker-name.your-subdomain.workers.dev/api/books \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer user@example.com" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "isbn": "9780451524935",
    "title": "1984",
    "authors": ["George Orwell"],
    "description": "A dystopian social science fiction novel...",
    "categories": ["Fiction", "Dystopian"],
    "shelf_id": 1,
    "tags": ["classic", "dystopian"]
  }'

# 5. Get all books
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer user@example.com" \
  https://your-worker-name.your-subdomain.workers.dev/api/books
```

## Security Considerations

### Authentication
- Currently uses email as Bearer token for simplicity
- Production should implement proper JWT verification
- All endpoints except `/api/users` require authentication

### Authorization
- Role-based access control with admin and user roles
- Admin users can create, update, and delete locations and shelves
- Regular users can only manage books
- Users can only access their own locations and books
- Location owners have full control over their locations and shelves
- Future: implement location sharing between users

### Data Privacy
- User emails are used only for identification
- No sensitive personal data is stored
- Book data is public information (ISBN lookups)
- Users have full control over their data

## Rate Limiting

Currently no rate limiting is implemented. For production deployment, consider:
- Request rate limits per user
- Bulk operation limits
- API key management for external integrations
