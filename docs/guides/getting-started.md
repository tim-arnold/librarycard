# Getting Started with LibraryCard

LibraryCard is a personal book library management system that lets you scan ISBN barcodes to automatically catalog your books with location tracking and custom tagging.

## Quick Start

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/tim-arnold/librarycard.git
cd librarycard
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

### 3. Set Up Local Development Environment

```bash
# Copy environment template
cp .env.example .env.local

# Set up local database with sample data
node scripts/setup-local-db.js
```

This automated setup will:
- Initialize the database schema
- Apply all migrations
- Seed with 4 sample users and 3 locations
- Add 60 sample books (20 per location, across 2 shelves each)

### 4. Start Development Servers

```bash
# In terminal 1: Start Next.js frontend
npm run dev

# In terminal 2: Start Cloudflare Worker backend
npx wrangler dev --local
```

Visit `http://localhost:3000` to see the app running locally with full sample data.
