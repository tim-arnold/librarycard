# User Invitation System Refactoring Plan

## Overview

This document outlines the plan to refactor the user invitation system from its current location within the Locations management interface to a more appropriate location in the Admin Users interface. This refactoring will improve UX organization and consolidate user management functions under a single administrative interface.

## Current State Analysis

### Current Implementation
- **Location**: User invitations are managed within `LocationManager.tsx` (lines 433-534)
- **Access Path**: Locations tab → Select location → "Invitations" button → Invitation management
- **Functions Available**:
  - View pending/accepted invitations for a specific location
  - Send new invitations to email addresses
  - Revoke pending invitations
  - Track invitation status (pending/accepted/expired)

### Current Interface Structure
```
LocationManager.tsx
├── Location creation/editing
├── Shelf management per location
└── Invitation management per location ← TO BE MOVED
    ├── loadLocationInvitations()
    ├── sendInvitation()
    ├── revokeInvitation()
    └── Invitation UI components
```

### Current User Flow
1. Admin navigates to Locations tab
2. Selects a specific location
3. Clicks "Invitations" button in shelf management area
4. Views location-specific invitations
5. Can send/revoke invitations for that location only

## Proposed Changes

### New Implementation Location
- **Target Component**: `AdminUserManager.tsx`
- **Access Path**: Admin Dashboard → Users tab → Invitation management section
- **Integration**: Add invitation management as a new section within existing user management interface

### Proposed Interface Structure
```
AdminUserManager.tsx
├── User table with management actions
├── User cleanup/deletion functionality
├── Role management (promote/demote)
├── Email functionality
└── NEW: Invitation Management Section
    ├── Global invitation overview
    ├── Location-specific invitation management
    ├── Batch invitation operations
    └── Enhanced invitation tracking
```

## Implementation Details

### Phase 1: Component Structure Changes ✅ COMPLETE

#### 1.1 Add Invitation State Management to AdminUserManager ✅
```typescript
// COMPLETED - State variables added to AdminUserManager

✅ GET /api/admin/invitations              // All invitations across locations
✅ GET /api/admin/locations/simple         // Location list for dropdowns  
✅ POST /api/admin/invitations/bulk        // Bulk invitation sending
❌ GET /api/admin/invitations/analytics    // Invitation statistics - NOT IMPLEMENTED
```

#### 3.2 Existing Endpoint Modifications ✅ COMPLETE
- ✅ Enhanced existing invitation endpoints to support admin-level access
- ✅ Added filtering and pagination for large invitation lists
- ✅ Included location details in invitation responses

### Phase 4: UI/UX Improvements

#### 4.1 Consolidated User Management
- Single interface for all user-related administrative functions
- Consistent design patterns with existing AdminUserManager interface
- Improved navigation and discoverability

#### 4.2 Enhanced Data Presentation
```typescript
// New invitation table structure
interface InvitationTableRow {
  id: number
  email: string
  location_name: string
  location_id: number
  status: 'pending' | 'accepted' | 'expired'
  sent_date: string
  expires_date: string
  accepted_date?: string
  invited_by_name: string
  actions: JSX.Element[]
}
```

#### 4.3 Improved Form Handling
- Location selection dropdown
- Email validation and duplicate checking
- Bulk email input (textarea with email parsing)
- Form persistence and error handling

## Migration Strategy

### Step 1: Prepare AdminUserManager
1. Add invitation-related state variables
2. Create invitation management UI section (initially hidden)
3. Add necessary API functions
4. Implement basic invitation table/list view

### Step 2: Implement Core Features
1. Move invitation functions from LocationManager to AdminUserManager
2. Enhance functions for global scope (all locations vs. single location)
3. Add location selection functionality
4. Implement new API endpoints

### Step 3: Enhanced Features
1. Add filtering, sorting, and search capabilities
2. Implement bulk operations
3. Add invitation analytics and status tracking
4. Enhance error handling and user feedback

### Step 4: Remove from LocationManager
